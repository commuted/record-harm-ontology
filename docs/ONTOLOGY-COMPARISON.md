# Ontology Comparison: Record Harm vs. Related Frameworks

This document maps the Record Harm Ontology to established frameworks in information security, archival science, and diplomatics.

## Overview

The Record Harm Ontology focuses on **ontological attacks on records** — how records can be damaged, destroyed, or corrupted as informational entities. While it shares concerns with other frameworks, its scope and granularity differ:

- **STRIDE** (threat modeling): Focuses on system security threats
- **CIA Triad** (information security): Focuses on confidentiality, integrity, availability
- **InterPARES Diplomatics**: Focuses on record authenticity and trustworthiness
- **Spoliation Doctrine** (legal): Focuses on evidence destruction and concealment

## Comparison Table

### Record Harm ↔ STRIDE

| Record Harm | STRIDE Category | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Fabrication** | Tampering | Both involve creating/modifying false information |
| **Alteration** | Tampering | Direct modification of existing data |
| **Destruction** | Denial of Service (partial) | DoS is transient unavailability; Destruction is permanent loss |
| **Suppression** | Denial of Service (partial) | Suppression is deliberate concealment; DoS is service disruption |
| **Denial** | Repudiation | Both involve denying validity/authorship |
| **Omission** | Information Disclosure (inverse) | Omission excludes; Disclosure leaks. Not direct opposites. |
| **ForgeryOfProvenance** | Spoofing | Both involve falsifying identity/origin |
| **Repudiation** | Repudiation | Direct mapping |
| **Contamination** | Tampering | Mixing genuine with false |
| **Decontextualization** | *(no direct mapping)* | STRIDE doesn't model context stripping |
| **Fragmentation** | *(no direct mapping)* | STRIDE doesn't model record fragmentation |
| **Obfuscation** | *(no direct mapping)* | STRIDE doesn't model deliberate obscurity |
| *(no mapping)* | **Information Disclosure** | **Deliberate gap**: Leaked records are undamaged as records |
| *(no mapping)* | **Elevation of Privilege** | Outside record harm scope (system access, not record integrity) |

**Key Differences:**
- **STRIDE is system-centric**; Record Harm is **record-centric**
- **STRIDE includes confidentiality** (Information Disclosure); Record Harm **deliberately excludes it** — a leaked record is authentic, complete, and accessible
- **Record Harm distinguishes Suppression from Destruction**; STRIDE conflates both under Denial of Service
- **Record Harm models composite harms**; STRIDE categories are flat

### Record Harm ↔ CIA Triad

| Record Harm | CIA Category | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|-------|
| **Destruction** | Availability | Permanent loss vs. transient unavailability |
| **Suppression** | Availability | Deliberate concealment vs. system failure |
| **Fabrication** | Integrity | Creating false records |
| **Alteration** | Integrity | Modifying existing records |
| **Contamination** | Integrity | Mixing genuine with false |
| **Omission** | Integrity | Incomplete records |
| **ForgeryOfProvenance** | Integrity + Authenticity | Falsifying origin/custody |
| **Denial** | Trustworthiness | Contesting legitimacy |
| **Repudiation** | Trustworthiness | Disavowing authorship |
| **Decontextualization** | Integrity | Stripping metadata/context |
| **Fragmentation** | Integrity + Availability | Breaking into disconnected pieces |
| **Obfuscation** | Availability | Degrading comprehensibility |
| *(no mapping)* | **Confidentiality** | **Deliberate gap**: See STRIDE notes above |

**Key Differences:**
- **CIA is property-centric** (what properties are violated); Record Harm is **action-centric** (what attacks occur)
- **CIA Integrity is broad**; Record Harm **distinguishes 6 prime harms** within integrity violations
- **CIA Availability conflates** destruction, suppression, and obfuscation; Record Harm **separates them**
- **Record Harm adds Trustworthiness** as a distinct aspect beyond CIA

### Record Harm ↔ InterPARES Diplomatics

InterPARES (International Research on Permanent Authentic Records in Electronic Systems) provides a framework for archival authenticity.

| Record Harm | Diplomatics Concept | Notes |
|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Authenticity** (aspect) | Authenticity | Core shared concept |
| **Context** (aspect) | Archival Bond | Both emphasize provenance and relationships |
| **Integrity** (aspect) | Completeness | Both require wholeness |
| **Fabrication** | Forgery | Creating false records |
| **Alteration** | Corruption | Unauthorized modification |
| **ForgeryOfProvenance** | False Provenance | Falsifying archival context |
| **Decontextualization** | Loss of Archival Bond | Severing from context |
| **Omission** | Incompleteness | Missing elements |
| **Destruction** | Loss | Permanent removal |
| **Suppression** | Concealment | Deliberate hiding |
| **Denial** | Contestation of Authenticity | Challenging legitimacy |
| **Fragmentation** | Dispersal | Breaking archival unity |
| **Contamination** | Adulteration | Mixing genuine with false |
| **Obfuscation** | Obscuration | Degrading intelligibility |
| **Repudiation** | Disavowal of Authorship | Denying creation |

**Key Similarities:**
- Both emphasize **authenticity and provenance**
- Both recognize **context as essential** to record meaning
- Both distinguish **form from content**

**Key Differences:**
- **Diplomatics is preservation-focused**; Record Harm is **attack-focused**
- **Diplomatics emphasizes archival bond** (relationships between records); Record Harm **models this via hasElement**
- **Diplomatics is community-calibrated**; Record Harm **includes inside-agent records** (memories, beliefs)

### Record Harm ↔ Spoliation Doctrine (Legal)

Spoliation doctrine addresses destruction or concealment of evidence in legal proceedings.

| Record Harm | Spoliation Concept | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Destruction** | Destruction of Evidence | Direct mapping |
| **Suppression** | Concealment/Withholding | Hiding evidence from discovery |
| **Alteration** | Tampering with Evidence | Modifying evidence |
| **Fabrication** | Fabrication of Evidence | Creating false evidence |
| **Omission** | Selective Production | Withholding relevant documents |
| **ForgeryOfProvenance** | False Chain of Custody | Falsifying evidence handling |
| **Contamination** | Tainting Evidence | Mixing genuine with false |
| **Denial** | Contesting Authenticity | Challenging evidence validity |
| **Repudiation** | Disavowal | Denying authorship/authority |
| **Decontextualization** | Selective Quotation | Removing context to mislead |
| **Fragmentation** | Partial Production | Producing incomplete sets |
| **Obfuscation** | Burying in Volume | Making evidence hard to find |

**Key Similarities:**
- Both recognize **destruction and concealment as distinct wrongs**
- Both address **chain of custody** (ForgeryOfProvenance)
- Both recognize **selective production** (Omission)

**Key Differences:**
- **Spoliation is adversarial** (litigation context); Record Harm is **general-purpose**
- **Spoliation focuses on intent and bad faith**; Record Harm **models the acts themselves**
- **Spoliation has legal remedies** (adverse inference, sanctions); Record Harm is **descriptive, not prescriptive**

## Unique Contributions of Record Harm Ontology

### 1. Inside-Agent Records (v3.1)

**No other framework explicitly models:**
- Memories as records
- Beliefs as records
- Self-directed harm (repression, self-deception, motivated forgetting)
- The agent/community boundary

**Example:** A witness repressing a memory is `ex:Suppression` where `perpetrator = bearer`. This is inexpressible in STRIDE, CIA, diplomatics, or spoliation.

### 2. Formal Dependency Structure

**Record Harm uniquely provides:**
- Distinction between **prime** (irreducible) and **composite** (derived) harms
- Explicit `buildsUpon` relationships
- Reasoner-derivable composite membership
- Transitive closure via SPARQL property paths

**Example:** `ex:Obfuscation buildsUpon ex:Suppression, ex:Alteration` — neither STRIDE nor CIA models this dependency.

### 3. Mereological Structure (v3.1)

**Record Harm uniquely models:**
- Records as composed of other records (`hasElement`)
- Community registers as records in their own right
- Non-admission as `Omission` from the register

**Example:** A parish register whose elements are individual testimonies. Refusing to admit a testimony is `ex:Omission` from that register.

### 4. Aspect-Based Targeting

**Record Harm provides:**
- 6 fundamental aspects (Existence, Authenticity, Integrity, Accessibility, Context, Trustworthiness)
- Multi-valued targeting (one harm can attack multiple aspects)
- Coverage guarantee (every aspect reachable from at least one prime)

**Example:** `ex:Alteration` targets both `Authenticity` and `Integrity` — CIA would only say "Integrity violation."

### 5. Event Layer with Severity

**Record Harm separates:**
- Harm **types** (abstract categories)
- Harm **events** (specific occurrences with dates, perpetrators, severity)

**Example:** Two `ex:Destruction` events can have different severities (destroying a parking receipt vs. a birth certificate).

## Integration Guidance

### For Information Security Practitioners

- **Track inside-agent harms** (belief manipulation, memory distortion)
- **Use `Contamination` for genuine/false mixing** in information ecosystems

## Limitations and Scope Boundaries

### What Record Harm Does NOT Cover

1. **Confidentiality breaches** — Deliberate exclusion (see notes above)
2. **System vulnerabilities** — STRIDE is better for this
3. **Access control** — Outside record harm scope
4. **Encryption/cryptography** — Technical implementation, not ontological harm
5. **Pure non-creation** — Witnessing without recording (see `ex:RecordHarm` scope note)

### What Record Harm DOES Cover

1. **Ontological attacks on records** — Existence, authenticity, integrity, accessibility, context, trustworthiness
2. **Inside-agent and inside-community records** — Memories, beliefs, registers, archives
3. **Self-directed harm** — Repression, self-deception, motivated forgetting
4. **Composite harm structures** — Dependencies and patterns
5. **Event tracking** — Specific occurrences with severity and attribution
